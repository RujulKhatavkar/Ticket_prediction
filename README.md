# Dynamic Ticket Pricing Using Boosting Techniques

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to employ machine learning algorithms and sentiment analysis to develop a predictive model for event ticket pricing. The aim is to enhance sales strategies and showcase the effectiveness of machine learning in optimizing pricing decisions within the entertainment industry.

## Methodology

The proposed approach integrates social media sentiment analysis with event management datasets to forecast ticket demand. The process encompasses data gathering, sentiment analysis, merging datasets, feature extraction, and training XGBoost and LightGBM models. The project results demonstrate the efficacy of both algorithms in optimizing ticket prices, enhancing sales strategies, and improving profitability for events in the entertainment industry.

## Challenges Encountered

During the project, challenges primarily revolved around time constraints and selecting the appropriate forecasting library. The limited timeframe posed difficulties in thoroughly exploring various options and conducting in-depth research. Uncertainty about the ideal library for forecasting added complexity to the decision-making process. Despite these obstacles, a diligent approach was maintained to adapt strategies and meet project goals effectively.

## Key Learnings

1. **Research and Learning:** Conducting research to address uncertainties deepened the understanding of different methodologies and their implications.

2. **Time Management:** Managing a project with time constraints taught valuable lessons in task prioritization, resource allocation, and balancing thorough research with practical implementation.

3. **Problem-Solving:** Overcoming challenges like selecting the right forecasting library enhanced the ability to critically evaluate options, seek advice, and make informed decisions to drive the project forward.
